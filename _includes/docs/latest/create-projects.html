<h2 id="create-projects">Create Projects</h2>

<p>After logging onto Azkaban, you will see the Projects page. This page will show you a list of all the projects that you have read permissions on. Projects where only group permissions as or those with a role with READ or ADMIN will not appear.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <a href="./images/emptyprojectpage.png" data-lightbox="emptyprojectpage" title="Project page">
      <img class="img-thumbnail img-figure" title="Empty Project Page" src="./images/emptyprojectpage.png" alt="Project Page" width="400" />
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If you are just starting out, the project page may be empty. However you can see all the existing projects by clicking on <strong>All Projects</strong>.</p>

<p>Clicking on <strong>Create Projects</strong> will pop open a dialog box. Enter in a unique project name and description of the project. The description can be changed in the future, but the project name cannot be. If you don't see this button, it is likely that the ability to create new projects has been locked down except for users with the proper permissions.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <a href="./images/createproject.png" data-lightbox="createproject" title="Create project">
      <img class="img-thumbnail img-figure" title="Create project" src="./images/createproject.png" alt="Create project" width="400" />
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After creating your project, an empty project page will appear. You will automatically be given ADMIN status for this project. Add and remove permissions by clicking on the <a href="#project-permissions">Permissions Button</a>.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <a href="./images/newprojectpage.png" data-lightbox="newprojectpage" title="New Project">
      <img class="img-thumbnail img-figure" title="New Project" src="./images/newprojectpage.png" alt="New Project" width="400" />
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If you have the proper permissions (which you should if you created the project), you can delete the project, update the description, upload files and view the project logs from this page.</p>
