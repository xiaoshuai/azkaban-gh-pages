<p>Azkaban is designed to be modular. We are able to plug in code to add viewer pages or execute jobs in a customizable manner. These pages will describe the azkaban-plugins that can be downloaded from <a href="{{ site.home }}/downloads.html">the download page</a> and how to extend Azkaban by creating your own plugins or extending an existing one.</p>
