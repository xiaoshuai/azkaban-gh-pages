<p>Azkaban job type plugin design provides great flexibility for developers to create any type of job executors which can work with essentially all types of systems -- all managed and triggered by the core Azkaban work flow management.</p>

<p>Here we provide a common set of plugins that should be useful to most hadoop related use cases, as well as sample job packages. Most of these job types are being used in LinkedIn's production clusters, only with different configurations. We also give a simple guide how one can create new job types, either from scratch or by extending the old ones.</p>
