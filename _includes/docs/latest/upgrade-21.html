<p>The <code>update_2.1_to_3.0.sql</code> needs to be run to alter all the tables. This includes several table alterations and a new table.</p>

<p>Here are the changes:</p>

<ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Modify 'name' column to be 255 characters</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

</ul>

<h3>Importing Existing Schedules from 2.1</h3>

<p>In 3.0, the scheduling system is merged into the new triggering system. The information will be persisted in <code>triggers</code> table in DB. We have a simple tool to import your existing schedules into this new table.</p>
