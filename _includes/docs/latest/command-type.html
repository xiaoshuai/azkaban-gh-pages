<h2 id="command-type">Command Job Type (built-in)</h2>

<p>The command job type is one of the basic built-in types. It runs multiple UNIX commands using java processbuilder.  Upon execution, Azkaban spawns off a process to run the command.</p>

<h3>How To Use</h3>

<p>One can run one or multiple commands within one command job. Here is what is needed:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-condensed">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Command</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>command</td>
      <td>The full command to run</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For multiple commands, do it like <code>command.1, command.2</code>, etc.</p>
