<p class="lead">In version 3.0 we provide three modes: the stand alone "solo-server" mode, the heavier weight two server mode and distributed multiple-executor mode. The following describes the differences between the two modes.</p>

<p>In <strong>solo server mode</strong>, the DB is embedded H2 and both web server and executor server run in the same process. This should be useful if one just wants to try things out. It can also be used on small scale use cases.</p>

<p>The <strong>two server mode</strong> is for more serious production environment. Its DB should be backed by MySQL instances with master-slave set up. The web server and executor server should run in different processes so that upgrading and maintenance shouldn't affect users.</p>

<p>The <strong>multiple executor mode</strong> is for most serious production environment. Its DB should be backed by MySQL instances with master-slave set up. The web server and executor servers should ideally run in different hosts so that upgrading and maintenance shouldn't affect users. This multiple host setup brings in robust and scalable aspect to Azkaban.</p>
